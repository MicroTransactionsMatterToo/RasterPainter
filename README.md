### Raster Graphics for Dungeondraft
RasterPainter is a mod for Dungeondraft that implements basic raster graphics capabilities in the form of a simple layer based editor.


### Features
- Import external files into your map (WebP, PNG and JPEG supported)
- Export raster layers to image files for editing (Export formats: WebP, PNG and JPEG)
- Full Undo and Redo Support (Requires [_Lib](https://cartographyassets.com/assets/31828/_lib/))
- Multiple brushes (Solid Line, Path and Dynamic Shadow)


### Tips
- Hold SHIFT to draw straight lines
- Check that Snap to Grid is turned off if you want smooth lines


#### IMPORTANT!
Due to limitations of Dungeondrafts modding API, layers are stored in your `.dungeondraft_map` file, which will increase file sizes, save and load times. This can be mitigated to an extent by modifying the *Render Scale* in settings **(requires _Lib to be installed)**
