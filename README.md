### Raster Graphics for Dungeondraft
RasterPainter is a mod for Dungeondraft that implements basic raster graphics capabilities in the form of a simple layer based editor.


### Features
- Import external files into your map (WebP, PNG and JPEG supported)
- Export raster layers to image files for editing (Export formats: WebP, PNG and JPEG)
- Full Undo and Redo Support (Requires [_Lib](https://cartographyassets.com/assets/31828/_lib/))
- Draw and blend terrain seamlessly
- Layer opacity and tinting
- Layers persist even if map is loaded without the mod

### Installation
Download the zip of the repo from [here](https://codeload.github.com/MicroTransactionsMatterToo/RasterPainter/zip/refs/heads/main) or using the green Code button, and unzip it into your mod directory
Then install [_Lib](https://cartographyassets.com/assets/31828/_lib/)


#### IMPORTANT!
Due to limitations of Dungeondrafts modding API, layers are stored in your `.dungeondraft_map` file, which will increase file sizes, save and load times. This can be mitigated to an extent by modifying the *Render Scale* in settings **(requires _Lib to be installed)**

Also, please make a backup of your map file while using the mod! I've done my best to avoid crashes, but I can't make guarantees
